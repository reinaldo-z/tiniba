!mtim determines the maximum number of "timing slots" available
 integer,parameter :: mtim=1999

! timeopt is a flag which indicates the suppression or not of the timing.
 integer,save :: timopt=1

! papiopt is a flag which indicates if there is or not an analysis of speed execution is made. 
! By defaut the analysis is not done 
 integer,save :: papiopt=0

! initpapiopt is a flag which permits initialisation of overall timing by papi and speed of run
 integer,save :: initpapiopt=1 

! Number of times that the routine has been called
 integer,save :: ncount(mtim)

! Accumulating cpu time (1) and wall to wall time (2) for each "timing slots"
 real(dp),save  :: acctim(2,mtim),tzero(2,mtim)

! Accumulating number of floating point operation and cpu time (1) and wall to wall times (2) for each "performance slot"
 real(dp),save :: papi_accflops(mtim), papi_acctim(2,mtim)

! Reference value for number of floating point operation and time ( cpu and wall) for each performance slot
 real(dp),save :: papi_flops(mtim) , papi_tzero(2,mtim)

! Elapsed time and elapsed number of floating point operation since a reference
 real(dp),save :: papi_tottim(2,mtim), papi_totflops(mtim)
