  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   12.537520 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   12.537520 Hartrees makes boxcut=2
